/**
 * Contains solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems
 * that are based on the String data structure.
 * <p>
 * This package serves as a collection of different algorithmic techniques
 * and patterns applied to strings. It explores common problems involving
 * character manipulation, searching, and pattern matching.
 * <p>
 * Problems are organized into sub-packages, each dedicated to a specific
 * challenge. Examples of patterns and problems found within this package include:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Two-Pointers and Sliding Windows</li>
 *     <li>Anagrams and Character Frequency Counting</li>
 *     <li>Palindrome Detection</li>
 *     <li>Substring Searching (e.g., KMP, Rabin-Karp)</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Each subpackage provides one or more solutions, often with detailed
 * documentation on the time and space complexity trade-offs of each approach.
 *
 * @version 1.0
