/**
 * Contains solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems
 * that are based on the Array data structure.
 *
 * <p>This package serves as a comprehensive collection of different algorithmic
 * techniques and patterns applied to arrays. It explores common problems
 * involving searching, sorting, and manipulation of array elements.
 *
 * <p>Problems are organized into sub-packages, each dedicated to a specific
 * challenge. Examples of patterns and problems found within this package include:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Sliding Window and Two-Pointers</li>
 *     <li>Frequency Counting with Maps</li>
 *     <li>Matrix Traversal and Manipulation</li>
 *     <li>Subarray Sums and Products</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Each sub-package provides one or more solutions, often with detailed
 * documentation on the time and space complexity trade-offs of each approach.
