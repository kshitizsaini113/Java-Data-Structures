/**
 * Provides utilities for performing array rotation operations.
 *
 * <p>This package contains classes that implement efficient algorithms
 * to rotate an integer array to the right by a given number of steps.
 * The rotation is performed in-place using constant extra space.</p>
 *
 * <p>Key concepts used:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Modulo operation to handle large rotation counts</li>
 *   <li>Array reversal technique for optimal performance</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
