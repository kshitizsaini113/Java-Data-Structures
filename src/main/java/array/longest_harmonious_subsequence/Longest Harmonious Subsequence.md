# Longest Harmonious Subsequence

We define a harmonious array as an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is
**exactly** 1.

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of its longest harmonious _subsequence_ among all its possible
subsequences.

A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without
changing the order of the remaining elements.
