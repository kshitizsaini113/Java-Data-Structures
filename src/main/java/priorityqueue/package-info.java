/**
 * This package contains implementations of the Priority Queue data structure.
 *
 * <p>A priority queue is an abstract data type that operates like a regular queue
 * but with a twist: each element has an associated "priority". Elements with
 * higher priority are served before elements with lower priority. If two elements
 * share the same priority, their order is determined by their position in the queue.
