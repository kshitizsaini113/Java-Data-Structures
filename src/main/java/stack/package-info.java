/**
 * Provides implementations of the Stack data structure, a fundamental linear
 * data structure that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.
 *
 * <p>In a stack, the last element added to the collection is the first one to be
 * removed. This package contains various implementations, such as array-based
 * or linked-list-based stacks, demonstrating different approaches to this
 * classic data structure.

 * @version 2.0
